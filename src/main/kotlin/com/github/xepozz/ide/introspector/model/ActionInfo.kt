/**
 * Metadata for one registered [com.intellij.openapi.actionSystem.AnAction] entry —
 * the JSON shape returned by `arch.list_actions`.
 *
 * Field semantics:
 *  - [id] is the action id from `ActionManager` (e.g. `"EditorCopy"`); always non-null.
 *  - [text] / [description] come from the action's template presentation. Both are null
 *    when the action is a registry stub that has not been class-loaded yet (the action
 *    walker keeps the entry rather than throwing — stubs are real, just unresolved).
 *  - [providedByPluginId] / [providedByPluginName] are sourced from the reverse map built
 *    from every `PluginDescriptor` via `ActionManagerEx.getPluginActions(pluginId)`. Both
 *    are null for actions registered by the core platform with no discoverable owner
 *    (the project's models elsewhere use `null` rather than the string `"unknown"`).
 *  - [keyboardShortcuts] is the comma-joined human-readable form, e.g. `"Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Insert"`,
 *    or null when the keymap has no binding for that id.
 *  - [category] is reserved for the action-group ancestry path (e.g. `"Main Menu/Refactor"`).
 *    Computing it for every entry is too expensive at the cap, so we ship the field but
 *    populate it lazily later — current implementation leaves it null.
 *  - [iconPath] is the icon resource path from `templatePresentation.icon?.toString()`,
 *    or null when no icon is registered. Best-effort: some icons stringify to garbage.
 *  - [isInternal] mirrors `AnAction.isInternal()` (delegates to `<action internal="true">`).
 *    By default the catalog excludes these entries — pass `includeInternal=true` to opt in.
